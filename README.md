**A Chrome Debugging Tools API for Node JS**

This project intends to fully implement and expose the Chrome Remote Debugging Tools API (v1.0). The specification is available [here.](https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/docs/protocol/1.0/index)

To get started, you will need to run Chrome/Chromium with the ```--remote-debugging-port``` flag:

Mac OS:

``` /Applications/Chromium.app/Contents/MacOS/Chromium --remote-debugging-port=9000```

To install dependencies, ```npm install``` should do the trick.
